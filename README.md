# SoaP-sheets-script
Quick javascript script i created for google sheets that helps enable the GMU School of Art Print Studio to better keep track of incoming, in progress, and completed orders.

The script contains a few pieces of functionality. The first is that it will create a timestamp for their order when a person pays for their print order. The sheet has a few checkboxes that keep track of where in the process someones print is at, and when a order is finally marked as completed, the row is automatically hidden from view. There is also a custom tab at the top that will allow employees to either view all completed orders automatically, or rehide all completed orders.
